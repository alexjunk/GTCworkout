# Kunbus : the revolution PI

https://revolutionpi.de/shop/en/revpi-compact

The RevPi Compact is an open source compact controller based on the Raspberry Pi 3+ ­Compute Module. The open ­platform concept (including full root rights) allows the user maximum design freedom in the implementation of his projects. To connect sensors and actuators, the RevPi Compact is equipped with eight ­digital and analog inputs each as well as eight digital and two ­analog outputs. Two Ethernet interfaces (each with a separate MAC address) enable the ­device to be integrated in two different networks at the same time. In addition, the device has a 4-pole RS485 interface with screw terminals. The flat design makes it possible to install the device in a subdistribution system that is usually found in building automation.

A customized Raspbian with Real-Time Patch is used as operating system. Individual applications can be programmed via, amongst other things, Node-RED, Python or ­directly in C. The popular industrial protocols Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP are supported by default.
